<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Orphan genes are species-specific, having associated with evolution of a given species. They are ubiquitous in procaryotes, eukaryotes and virus, and have functions ranging from prey paralysis to survival in subzero temperatures to metabolic regulation. Because they are typically expressed under limited conditions and they lack canonical features, orphan genes are vastly under-identified, even in humans.
Terabytes of human RNA-Seq raw data was used to identify highly-expressed novel transcripts that do not correspond to any annotated gene (termed Evidence Based or EB genes).
80% of EB genes are orphan genes. We validate these findings with independent strand-specific RNA-seq.
A cadre of novel orphan genes are expressed specifically in individual cell types in particular organs.
Single nuclei RNA-Seq data from lungs of fetal and adult individuals reveal yet another component, developmental stage-specific expression in single cell types.
Hundreds of  novel EB orphan genes overlap with deleterious genomic variants; thousands show significant association with disease-specific patient survival. Most are dynamically regulated and selectively accumulated across tissues, cell-types, tumors, genders, and ancestries, and have potential as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets in these biological contexts.
